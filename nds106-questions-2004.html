<h1>NDS106 Unit1 (Security) Exam Questions</h1>

<h2>Question 1.</h2>

<p>a) Describe what are, in your opinion, three of the most important
vulnerabilities currently affecting distributed systems. In each case,
recommend and describe a (set of) countermeasue(s) which can reduce the risk
associated with the vulnerability and comment on any associated
implementation and/or deployment issues. (15)</p>

<p>b) Justify the selectiion you made in part (a) (e.g. by comparing the
overall impact of the vulnerabilities you selected against other named
vulnerabilities) (5)</p>

<p>c) Outline an approach you might take during system design so that the end
product is less likely to suffer from exploitable vulnerabilities. (5).</p>

<h2>Question 2.</h2>

<p>Alice works in a highly progressive county council which is planning to
web-enable its system for handling planning permission applications.</p>

<p>The system has to allow new planning applications to be entered either by
a member of the public or by a professional (e.g. architect, draftsperson) on
behalf of a member of the public. Applications consist of a number of
documents/drawings etc. which must meet many complex planning regulations (so
successfully entering a new application may require a few iterations). There
are fees which must be paid prior to entering a new application.</p>

<p>The system must allow for applications which are initially accepted to be
viewed by members of the public for a certain period and for planning
objections to be entered (and subsequently displayed). Planning objections
may come from members of the public who are likely to be affected by the
plan, or from certain other organisations (e.g. An Taisce or other
environmental concerns). Updates to the status of the plans may only be made
by planners, and details of such changes must be documented (e.g. a planner
may approve a plan but only subject to some changes). The system should be
designed so as to be as legally "robust" as possible, since Alice is well
aware that planning disputes often end up in court.</p>

<p>a) Describe an overall architecture for Alice's planning system, in
particular how each component affects the overall security of the system.
(10)</p>

<p>b) Describe how the various types of user of Alice's system might be
authenticated (note that no single authentication mechanism is likely to suit
all of these various type of user) and also describe the type(s) of
authorization technology which you would recommend that Alice should employ.
(10)</p>

<p>c) Describe how you could alleviate Alice's concerns with respect to her
having to defend her system in court during a planning dispute, but without
breaking the system or making it too cumbersome to use. (5)</p>

<h2>Question 3.</h2>

<p>a) Discuss the use of cryptography in some practical key management scheme
(e.g. the SSL/TLS handshake or IPsec's IKEv2 or S/MIME), and describe some of
the advantages/pitfalls of how cryptography is used in your chosen scheme.
(15)</p>

<p>b) Define and describe the "Electronic Code Book " and "Cipher Block
Chaining" modes of operation of block ciphers and give examples of when each
is suited for, and not suited for, use. (5)</p>

<p>c) Describe some of the implementation options for private or secret key
storage and use and their consequences (5)</p>
