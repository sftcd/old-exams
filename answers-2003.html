<h2>Question 1.</h2>

<h2>1a. Describe the 1988 Internet worm and its effects. In particular,
describe, in detail, the main ways in which the worm propogated and explain
what caused the worm to disrupt the network.</h2>

<p>Marking scheme: 10 points available</p>

<p>3 Points for overall correctness/clarity of description; thereafter
inclusion of each of the points below (from Spafford's report) gains a
half-point to a max of 6 points; clear errors (e.g. describing the worm as a
virus) incur a negative 1/2 point; 1 additional point for relevant, correct
things I haven't mentioned</p>
<ul>
  <li>The November 1988 Internet worm was nicely and fully described by
    Spafford in his report titled "The Internet Worm Program: An
  Analysis"</li>
  <li>The program was a worm and not a virus since it didn't infect any other
    programs</li>
  <li>The concept of a worm program that spreads itself from machine to
    machine was apparently first described by John Brunner in 1975 in his
    classic science fiction novel "The Shockwave Rider"</li>
  <li>In 1979-1981, researchers at Xerox PARC built and experimented with
    worm programs. They reported their experiences in an article in 1982 in
    Communications of the ACM.</li>
  <li>The worm infected Sun Microsystems Sun 3 systems, and VAX computers
    running variants of 4 BSD1 UNIX</li>
  <li>The weaknesses exploited had been well known but the attack still
    caused great surprise</li>
  <li>Initial workarounds included renaming the C compiler</li>
  <li>Once infected, all a host's CPU cycles were ultimately consumed by the
    worm which effectively disconnected that host from the Internet</li>
  <li>The worm code was "captured" and reverse-enigineered/de-compiled</li>
  <li>The worm didn't actually do specific damage to hard drives</li>
  <li>Methods/aspects of propogation (1/2 point each) included: 
    <ul>
      <li>sendmail DEBUG option allowed script execution giving a shell then
        used to suck over the worm</li>
      <li>fingerd gets buffer overrun</li>
      <li>.rhosts files scanned then used</li>
      <li>/etc/passwd used to guess passwords to break into other accounts on
        the host (to presumably get other .rhosts files etc)</li>
      <li>optimised password guessing</li>
      <li>it tried password=variation of account-name</li>
      <li>list of "favorite" passwords</li>
      <li>use of /etc/dict and variations for password guesses</li>
      <li>/etc/hosts used to find nearby hosts to attempt to infect</li>
      <li>from-host started listener on random socket awaiting random
        challenge (to be harder to spot)</li>
      <li>the to-host compiler was used to compile the vector program which
        was then executed and which sent back the challenge string to the
        from-host's listener process on the appropriate socket</li>
      <li>the from-host then sent the remaining code</li>
      <li>the worm built a data structure in memory of known hosts and their
        status (e.g. infected)</li>
      <li>netstat used to find connected hosts</li>
      <li>random subnet-local addresses were tried</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The new worm on the infected host proceeded to
    &#x2018;&#x2018;hide&#x2019;&#x2019; itself by (1/2 point each): 
    <ul>
      <li>obscuring its argument vector,</li>
      <li>unlinking the binary version of itself, and</li>
      <li>killing its parent (the $$ argument in the invocation).</li>
      <li>It then read into memory each of the worm binary files, encrypted
        each file after reading it, and deleted the files from disk.</li>
      <li>It periodically forked and then killed the parent to get a
        different PID (but with a bug)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The worm checked whether other worms were running on this host and if
    so, exited in most cases (6/7)</li>
  <li>Some worm instances became immortal (1/7)</li>
  <li>The worm attempted to send an UDP packet to the host ernie.berkeley.edu
    probably to deflect blame</li>
  <li>The reasons why the worm used too much CPU include (1/2 point each as
    usual): 
    <ul>
      <li>Incorrect logic caused the worm to always try to infect some
        LAN-local host whenever a non-existent host was tried (and
      failed)</li>
      <li>Code to limit the number of instances per host was buggy</li>
      <li>Password cracking code was supposed to exit/sleep but didn't due to
        buggy code (a loop counter not being incremented)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The local &#x2018;&#x2018;Worm port&#x2019;&#x2019;&#x2014; 23357 was
    used to play a live/die protocol to thin out instances of worms on a host
    (but with bugs)</li>
</ul>

<h2>1c. Describe two other major, current types of threat (accidental or
deliberate, passive or active) and explain the type of countermeasures that
can practically (as opposed to theoretically) be put in place against
each.</h2>

  <li>Running a vulnerability/threat/risk analysis</li>
</ul>

<p>The remaining 2 points are available if they've done much better than
required on some part of the answer.</p>

<p>An example of the description of SQL slammer from CERT-2003-04 and related
material is below. I would not expect the same level of detail, but all major
points should be mentioned.</p>

<p>The vulnerability:</p>

<blockquote>
  The SQL Server Resolution Service (SSRS) was introduced in Microsoft SQL
  Server 2000 to provide referral services for multiple server instances
  running on the same machine. The service listens for requests on UDP port
  1434 and returns the IP address and port number of the SQL server instance
  that provides access to the requested database. The SSRS contains a stack
  buffer overflow that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code by
  sending a crafted request to port 1434/udp. The code within such a request
  will be executed by the server host with the privileges of the SQL Server
  service account.</blockquote>

<p>The exploit:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The propagation of this malicious code has caused varied levels of
  network degradation across the Internet and the compromise of vulnerable
  machines.</p>

  <p>The worm targeting SQL Server computers is self-propagating malicious
  code that exploits the vulnerability described in VU#484891
  (CAN-2002-0649). This vulnerability allows for the execution of arbitrary
  code on the SQL Server computer due to a stack buffer overflow. Once the
  worm compromises a machine, it will try to propagate itself. The worm will
  craft packets of 376-bytes and send them to randomly chosen IP addresses on
  port 1434/udp. If the packet is sent to a vulnerable machine, this victim
  machine will become infected and will also begin to propagate. Beyond the
  scanning activity for new hosts, the current variant of this worm has no
  other payload. Activity of this worm is readily identifiable on a network
  by the presence of 376-byte UDP packets. These packets will appear to be
  originating from seemingly random IP addresses and destined for port
  1434/udp.</p>

  <p>Compromise by the worm confirms a system is vulnerable to allowing a
  remote attacker to execute arbitrary code as the local SYSTEM user. It may
  be possible for an attacker to subsequently leverage a local privilege
  escalation exploit in order to gain Administrator access to the victim
  system. The high volume of 1434/udp traffic generated by hosts infected
  with the worm trying to find and compromise other SQL Server computers may
  itself lead to performance issues (including possible denial-of-service
  conditions) for Internet-connected hosts or for those computers on networks
  with compromise hosts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The counter:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use open source databases.</p>

  <p>Apply a patch from Microsoft.</p>

  <p>Ingress/Egress controls: The propagation of the worm requires a process
  listening on port 1434/udp to exploit this vulnerability. This precondition
  is obviously present in SQL Server 2000. However, not all applications
  using MSDE 2000 listen to the network by default. Therefore, only certain
  MSDE 2000-enabled applications may be vulnerable. Ingress/egress filtering
  The following steps are only effective in limiting the damage that can be
  done by systems already infected with the worm. They provide no protection
  against the initial infection of systems. As a result, these steps are only
  recommended in addition to the preventative steps outlined above. Ingress
  filtering manages the flow of traffic as it enters a network under your
  administrative control. Servers are typically the only machines that need
  to accept inbound traffic from the public Internet. In the network usage
  policy of many sites, external hosts are only permitted to initiate inbound
  traffic to machines that provide public services on specific ports. Thus,
  ingress filtering should be performed at the border to prohibit externally
  initiated inbound traffic to non-authorized services. Egress filtering
  manages the flow of traffic as it leaves a network under your
  administrative control. There is typically limited need for machines
  providing public services to initiate outbound connections to the Internet.
  In the case of this worm, employing ingress and egress filtering can help
  prevent compromised systems on your network from attacking systems
  elsewhere. Blocking UDP datagrams with both source or destination ports
  1434 from entering or leaving your network reduces the risk of external
  infected systems communicating with infected hosts inside your network.</p>

<h1>Question 2. </h1>

<h3>Alice's company is a medium-sized enterprise (500 employees) selling both
digital and tangible goods. Alice is setting up a secure commerce site for
the company. For various reasons she requires that her company physically
host all of the computer systems involved so there will be no outsourcing of
primary systems to e.g. a data centre. Alice is however concerned about her
and her customers' security and privacy. Alice's company already have a LAN
for internal use and also allow remote access for Alice and her sales staff.
Alice is also concerned to secure this remote access. Finally, Alice is also
worried that one of her staff might be accessing materials that would bring
the company into disrepute were it to be known, so she would like to be able
to control, or at least monitor, for such undesirable behaviour.</h3>

<h2>2a. Outline an architecture for Alice's network, emphasising how each
component affects the overall security of the system.</h2>

<p>Marking scheme: 15 points available</p>

<p>Overall clarity and correctness: 3 points.</p>

<p>For a sensible network diagram: 3 points available. The answer should
include a diagram showing the main hosts and network connections similar to
that shown below, but need not have as much detail in terms of addressing and
should have more detail in terms of the hosts (see below). The network
diagram should separate out the following hosts/components</p>

<p><ul>

<p>For including each of the following aspects within Alice's network, 1
point, up to a max of 7:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Separate physical interfaces on the firewall for inner,DMZ and ISP
    connections</li>
  <li>Having two different firewall "products" (possibly one simply using
    ipchains) so as to be less likely to fall victim to one single
    programming flaw</li>
  <li>Keeping customer information on a separate DB host on the inner network
    (or at least without direct access to the Internet)</li>
  <li>Stating the type of traffiic filtering that should be put in place</li>
  <li>Using a VPN for remote (and possibly 802.11) access</li>
  <li>Having a RADIUS server check for e.g. VPN logins</li>
  <li>Describing which traffic will be layered on top of SSL</li>

    information separate from customer browsing patterns)</li>
  <li>Having a (monitored!) privacy policy</li>
</ul>

<p>2 additional points are available if the answer also describes additional
major functional blocks in interesting levels of detail, for example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Describing a backup scheme</li>
  <li>Describing a disaster recovery scheme</li>

<p>Marking scheme: 5 points available</p>

<p>1 point: Describing how the transaction moves from browsing to purshasing
(e.g. via a shopping basket) and how that turns on server-side SSL.</p>

<p>1 point: Describing how CC# details are handled, and that tests are
carried out (incl. shipping addr=billing addr for physical goods)</p>

<p>1 point: Describing how CC payments are authorized, in multiple stages for

goods are MOTO transactions</p>

<p>1 point: Correct use of payments terms throughout: cardholder, merchant,
acquiring bank, issuing bank</p>

<p>1 additional point for overall clarity and correctness.</p>

published to the employees</p>

<p>1 point for providing details of such policies</p>

<p>1 point for including URL blockers and incoming spam mail filters (i.e.
for suggesting tehnical fixes on inbound traffic)</p>

<p>1 point for suggesting that system adminstrators ought to occasionally

spot unexpected usage patterns; (i.e. for suggesting that Alice's IT staff
should be capable enough to solve/detect this one)</p>

<p>1 additonal point for overall clarity and correctness, and also perhaps
for mention of more complex in-&amp;out-bound content scanning technologies
(e.g. carnivore like systems, products like porn-sweeper)</p>

SSL/TLS, IPsec or S/MIME key management to the level provided below: 7
points; each obvious error is -1/2 point; 3 additional points for pros &amp;
cons according the list below; 2 points are for overall correctness/clarity
and 2 points for doing really well.</p>

<p>The description below is the overview section from the (4-th) IKEv2
draft:</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre>   3 IKE Protocol Overview

   IP Security (IPsec) provides confidentiality, data integrity, access
   control, and data source authentication to IP datagrams. These
   services are provided by maintaining shared state between the source
   and the sink of an IP datagram. This state defines, among other
   things, the specific services provided to the datagram, which
   cryptographic algorithms will be used to provide the services, and
   the keys used as input to the cryptographic algorithms.

   Establishing this shared state in a manual fashion does not scale
   well.  Therefore a protocol to establish this state dynamically is
   needed.  This memo describes such a protocol-- the Internet Key
   Exchange (IKE).  This is version 2 of IKE. Version 1 of IKE was
   defined in RFCs 2407, 2408, and 2409. This single document is
   intended to replace all three of those RFCs.

   IKE performs mutual authentication between two parties and
   establishes an IKE security association that includes shared secret
   information that can be used to efficiently establish SAs for ESP
   (RFC 2406) and/or AH (RFC 2402).  It also negotiates use of IPcomp
   (RFC 2393) in connection with an ESP and/or AH SA.  We call the IKE
   SA an "IKE-SA". The SAs for ESP and/or AH that get set up through
   that IKE-SA we call "CHILD-SA"s.

   We call the first four messages establishing an IKE-SA a "phase 1"
   exchange and subsequent IKE exchanges "phase 2", inheriting this
   terminology from IKEv1. The phase 1 exchange establishes the IKE-SA
   and the first CHILD-SA. In some scenarios, only a single CHILD-SA is
   needed between the IPsec endpoints and therefore there would be no
   phase 2 exchanges. Phase 2 exchanges MAY be used to establish
   additional CHILD-SAs between the same authenticated pair of endpoints
   and to perform housekeeping functions.  The phase 1 exchange consists
   of two request/response pairs.  A phase 2 exchange is one
   request/response pair, and can be used to create or delete a CHILD-
   SA, rekey or delete the IKE-SA, or report information such as error
   conditions.

   IKE message flow always consists of a request followed by a response.
   It is the responsibility of the requester to ensure reliability.  If
   the response is not received within a timeout interval, the requester
   MUST retransmit the request (or abandon the connection).

   The first request/response of a phase 1 exchange negotiates security
   parameters for the IKE-SA, sends nonces, and sends Diffie-Hellman
   values. We call the initial exchange IKE_SA_INIT (request and
   response).

   The second request/response, which we'll call IKE_AUTH transmits
   identities, proves knowledge of the secrets corresponding to the two
   identities, and sets up an SA for the first (and often only) AH
   and/or ESP CHILD-SA.

   Phase 2 exchanges each consist of a single request/response pair. The
   types of exchanges are CREATE_CHILD_SA (which creates a CHILD-SA), or
   an Informational exchange which deletes an SA, reports error
   conditions, or does other housekeeping.  All these messages require a
   response. An informational message with no payloads is commonly used
   as a check for liveness.

   In the description that follows, we assume that no errors occur.
   Modifications to the flow should errors occur are described in
   section 4.

3.1 Usage Scenarios

   IKE is expected to be used to negotiate ESP and/or AH SAs in a number
   of different scenarios, each with their own special requirements.

3.1.1 Gateway to Gateway Tunnel

                    +-+-+-+-+-+            +-+-+-+-+-+
                    !         ! IPsec      !         !
       Protected    !Tunnel   ! Tunnel     !Tunnel   !     Protected
	   Subnet   ----!Endpoint !------------!Endpoint !---- Subnet
                    !         !            !         !
                    +-+-+-+-+-+            +-+-+-+-+-+

                       Figure 1:  Firewall to Firewall Tunnel

   In this scenario, neither endpoint of the IP connection implements
   IPsec, but network nodes between them protect traffic for part of the
   way. Protection is transparent to the endpoints, and depends on
   ordinary routing sending packets through the tunnel endpoints for
   processing. Each endpoint would announce the set of addresses
   "behind" it, and packets would be sent in Tunnel Mode where the inner
   IP header would contain the IP addresses of the actual endpoints.

3.1.2 Endpoint to Endpoint Transport

       +-+-+-+-+-+                                          +-+-+-+-+-+
       !         !                 IPsec                    !         !
       !Protected!                 Tunnel                   !Protected!
	   !Endpoint !------------------------------------------!Endpoint !
       !         !                                          !         !
       +-+-+-+-+-+                                          +-+-+-+-+-+

                       Figure 2:  Endpoint to Endpoint

   In this scenario, both endpoints of the IP connection implement
   IPsec. These endpoints may implement application layer access
   controls based on the authenticated identities of the participants.
   Transport mode will commonly be used with no inner IP header. If
   there is an inner IP header, the inner addresses will be the same as
   the outher addresses. A single pair of addresses will be negotiated
   for packets to be sent over this SA.

   It is possible in this scenario that one of the protected endpoints
   will be behind a network address translation (NAT) node, in which
   case the tunnelled packets will have to be UDP encapsulated so that
   port numbers in the UDP headers can be used to identify individual
   endpoints "behind" the NAT.

3.1.3 Endpoint to Gateway Transport

       +-+-+-+-+-+                          +-+-+-+-+-+
       !         !         IPsec            !         !     Protected
       !Protected!         Tunnel           !Tunnel   !     Subnet
	   !Endpoint ! -------------------------!Endpoint ! ---- and/or
       !         !                          !         !     Internet
       +-+-+-+-+-+                          +-+-+-+-+-+

                       Figure 3:  Endpoint to Gateway

   In this scenario, a protected endpoint (typically a portable roaming
   computer) connects back to its corporate network through an IPsec
   protected tunnel. It might use this tunnel only to access information
   on the corporate network or it might tunnel all of its traffic back
   through the corporate network in order to take advantage of
   protection provided by a corporate firewall against Internet based
   attacks. In either case, the protected endpoint will want an IP
   address associated with the gateway so that packets returned to it
   will go to the gateway and be tunnelled back. This IP address may be
   static or may be dynamically allocated by the gateway. In support of
   the latter case, IKEv2 includes a mechanism for the initiator to
   request an IP address owned by the gateway for use for the duration
   of its SA.

   In this scenario, packets will use tunnel mode. On each packet from
   the protected endpoint, the outer IP header will contain the source
   IP address associated with its current location (i.e. the address
   that will get traffic routed to the endpoint directly) while the
   inner IP header will contain the source IP address assigned by the
   gateway (i.e. the address that will get traffic routed to the gateway
   for forwarding to the endpoint). The outer destination address will
   always be that of the gateway, while the inner destination address
   will be the ultimate destination for the packet.

   In this scenario, it is possible that the protected endpoint will be
   behind a NAT. In that case, the IP address as seen by the gateway
   will not be the same as the IP address sent by the protected
   endpoint, and packets will have to be UDP encapsulated in order to be
   routed properly.

3.1.4 Other Scenarios

   Other scenarios are possible, as are nested combinations of the
   above.  One noteable example combines aspects of 3.1.1 and 3.1.3. A
   subnet may make all external accesses through a remote gateway using
   an IPsec tunnel, where the addresses on the subnet are routed to the
   gateway by the rest of the Internet. An example would be someones
   home network being virtually on the Internet with static IP addresses
   even though connectivity is provided by an ISP that assigns a single
   dynamically assigned IP address (where the static IP addresses and an
   IPsec relay is provided by a third party located elsewhere).

<p>Up to 2.5 points for good descriptions of how D-H and/or RSA actually
work, ideally a the level of including g^a mod p in the D-H description and
M^e mod n and e.d=1 mod phi(n) in the RSA description.</p>

<p>1/2 point for each correct mention of one of the list items below up to a
total of 1.5 points:</p>
<ul>
  <li>D-H is better if you need perfect forward secrecy (PFS)</li>
  <li>For RSA sender needs no asymmetric keying material</li>
  <li>D-H E-E, E-S, S-S variants all have different properties - calling out
    any such distinguishing property is worth a 1/2</li>
  <li>Saying the these are the same wrt PKI aspects is good</li>
</ul>

<h2>3c) Define the term "adaptive chosen ciphertext attack" and briefly
outline how the Bleichenbacher attack against PKCS#1 works (note: you do not
need to supply the detail of the algorithm for the attack). Explain why
SSL/TLS implementations are more vulnerable to this attack compared to most
applications that use S/MIME.</h2>

<p>Marking scheme: 5 points available: 1 for a good definition; 3 for
explaining bleichenbacher correctly; 1 for the last bit. If someone gives a
really complete description of bleichenbacher then they get an extra 2 points
added on somewhere.</p>

<p>An "adaptive chosed ciphertext attack" is where the attacker iteratively
gets the private key holder to work on its behalf as an oracle, that is,
where the private key holder uses the private key on some (ciphertext) value
chosen by the attacker, and the attacker gets to see the results of that
operation (or information about the result), such that the attacker can take
the outcome at round n into account when choosing the ciphertext for roung
n+1</p>

<p>Bleichenbacher's attack is one of these, directed against PKCS#1 blocktype
2 padding of (not only, but most importantly) RSA encryption. Noticing that
C'=C*(S^e) mod N has a reasonable (about 1 in 2^16) chance of resulting in
PKCS#1 conformant padding (mainly that means starting with '0002'H). The
origiinal message M (as a number) was PKCS#1 conformant which means that we
know (by definition) that if B=2^(l-16), where l is the bit length of the RSA
modulus, then 2B &lt;= M &lt; 3B, which can be seen if you think of the block
diagram as a number. Similarly, if we know that the decryption of C' (M') is
conformant, then M is also in that range. Now since C'=C*(S^e) that means
that M'=M*S (droppong the "mod" operators and remembering the definition of
RSA, where C=M^e). So now that attacker knows S, and that M and M*S are
within the [2B,3B) range. Next we note (and I don't require a description of
the detail) that by iterating this oracle operator with successive Si values,
the attacker can narrow the range at each iteration, with the overall result
that about a million operations are required to find M for an 1024 bit RSA
key.</p>

<p>SSL/TLS implementations are more vulnerable because they're generally
within server code and can be called many times whereas S/MIME is mostly used
at clients where there's usually a warm-body who'd notice a million
messages.</p>
