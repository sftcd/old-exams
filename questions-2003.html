<h2>Question 1.</h2>

<p>a) Describe the 1988 Internet worm and its effects. In particular,
describe, in detail, the main ways in which the worm propogated and explain
what caused the worm to disrupt the network. (10)</p>

<p>b) Explain how current networks and applications might be vulnerable to
similar types of attack, in particular how web services (SOAP etc) might
enable such attacks. (5)</p>

<p>c) Describe two other major, current types of threat (accidental or
deliberate, passive or active) and explain the type of countermeasures that
can practically (as opposed to theoretically) be put in place against each
(10).</p>

<h2>Question 2.</h2>

<p>Alice's company is a medium-sized enterprise (500 employees) selling both
digital and tangible goods. Alice is setting up a secure commerce site for
the company. For various reasons she requires that her company physically
host all of the computer systems involved so there will be no outsourcing of
primary systems to e.g. a data centre. Alice is however concerned about her
and her customers' security and privacy. Alice's company already have a LAN
for internal use and also allow remote access for Alice and her sales staff.
Alice is also concerned to secure this remote access. Finally, Alice is also
worried that one of her staff might be accessing materials that would bring
the company into disrepute were it to be known, so she would like to be able
to control, or at least monitor, for such undesirable behaviour.</p>

<p>a) Outline an architecture for Alice's network, emphasising how each
component affects the overall security of the system. (15)</p>

<p>b) Describe how Alice's commerce site should process payments. (5)</p>

<p>c) Describe how you could alleviate Alice's concerns with respect to her
staff's Internet browsing habits. (5)</p>

<h2>Question 3.</h2>

<p>a) Outline a practical key management scheme (e.g. the SSL/TLS handshake
or IPsec's IKEv2 or S/MIME), and name some of the advantages/pitfalls of your
chosen scheme. (15)</p>

<p>b) Describe how key agreement (as in Diffie-Hellman) and key transport (as
in RSA) work, and when one might be better suited for use than the other.
(5)</p>

<p>c) Define the term "adaptive chosen ciphertext attack" and briefly outline
how the Bleichenbacher attack against PKCS#1 works (note: you do not need to
supply the detail of the algorithm for the attack). Explain why SSL/TLS
implementations are more vulnerable to this attack compared to most
applications that use S/MIME. (5)</p>
