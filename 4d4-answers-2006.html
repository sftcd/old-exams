<h1>CS 4D4 - Security Exam questions and answers 2006</h1>

<p>stephen.farrell@cs.tcd.ie</p>

<p>All questions carry 20 marks, the number of marks for each sub-part is
indicated in parenthesis.</p>

<p>I assume that they have to do 5 from 8 questions, including at least 2
from this section.</p>

<h2>Question 5</h2>

<p><b>You are a developer working for a software product development company.
They are starting work on a major new release of their main product which has
been on sale for a number of years. The product is for running web-based
communities, somewhat along the lines of flickr, i.e. the user's of the
product are the administrators of such community sites. You are tasked with
looking after security for this new release. (Note: for the purposes of this
question, describing how you would carry out the security analysis matters
much more than a description of the product.</b></p>

<p><b>(a) Describe how you would approach analysing the existing security and
privacy aspects of the product. (10)</b></p>

<p>The important thing is that they say that you should take a risk analysis
approach, ranking vulnerabilities by e.g. impact and probability of
occurrence and then further looking at the high/high cases. That, or an
equivalent approach, is worth 3 marks, depending on how well its
described.</p>

<p>There's one mark for a meaningful mention of privacy issues (mainly
becuase some may omit it entirely, so this is kind of a punishment for
that)</p>

<p>Other things that get marks when properly discussed/mentioned (1 each, up
to a max of 4; with 2 more for overall impression):</p>
<ul>
  <li>doing a black-box security review of the product</li>
  <li>design reviews</li>
  <li>code reviews</li>
  <li>talking to developers and users of earlier versions</li>
  <li>establishing how existing design documents and actual code match up</li>
  <li>looking at competing products to see what security measures they use
    and how to do better or at least as good</li>
  <li>performing the risk analysis from the point of view of the end-user, as
    well as the customer (the community site admin)</li>
  <li>considering the privacy expectations of the end-users and ensuring that
    e.g. archives etc. don't give too much information (e.g. real email
    addresses should not be exposed)</li>
</ul>

<p><b>(b) Name and briefly explain 3 significant vulnerabilities which would
be likely to be present in recent versions of the product. Explain the
countermeasures you would select to handle these. (10)</b></p>

<p>There are 3 marks for each, one for naming a significant vulnerability,
one for a countermeasure, and one for how well its described. And a single
mark for overall goodness. Possible vulnerabilities/counters that could be
used include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>masquerade as another user - proper account/session management &amp;
    use of TLS</li>
  <li>sybil attacks - logging IPs etc. &amp; imposing a limit on number of
    accounts </li>
  <li>including/attaching malware to messages/images - incorporate some
    scanning capability and a pluggable scanner framework</li>
  <li>URL guessing often allows access to unauthorised parts of the
    application - build in a proper access control model and enforce it</li>
  <li>password resets frequently vulnerable - train human operators, don't
    allow simple unauthenticated email to change contact info. for password
    reset without human intervention</li>
  <li>DoS based on disk filling - impose rate and size limits, use circular
    archives where appropriate</li>
  <li>DoS based on network attacks - ensure product runs on "hardened"
    version of OS with only minimal services running</li>
  <li>All/any of the usual code quality problems, buffer overruns, etc. -
    code review, static analysis tools, use of type-safe languages if
  possible</li>
</ul>

<h2>Question 6</h2>

<p><b>(a) What is the purpose of a public key infrastructure (PKI)? In other
words, what security requirements does a PKI aim to meet? (5)</b></p>

<p>One mark for overall correctness, one each for mentions of things like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>solving N^2 problem of key distribution via TTP</li>
  <li>binding names and other info to public keys </li>
  <li>imposing technical requirements on key management (e.g. x.509 policy
    stuff, key lengths etc.)</li>
  <li>supporting key life cycles (generation, registration, use, archiving,
    revocation...)
    <ul>
      <li>perhaps with constraints on each stage </li>
      <li>individual points above can all be worth one mark</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>provide a standard basis for applications/protocols to use asymmettric
    crypto</li>
  <li>provide a secure way to support inter-domain operation (even if it
    doesn't really scale well enough;-)</li>
  <li>provide a standard, secure way to discover public keys (and e.g.
    certificate paths)</li>
</ul>

<p><b>(b) Describe how the XML Key Management System (XKMS) supports the
requirements you identified in part (a). (5)</b></p>

<p>Basically this is an opportunity for a blow-by-blow description of XKMS
and how it supports PKIs. Straight marks from 5 for how well they do this.
They ought e.g. to distinguish X-KRSS from X-KISS, to say that locate !=
validate and that X-KRSS supports registration, revocation etc.</p>

<p><b>(c) What are some of the advantages and/or disadvantages of using XKMS
over a "pure" X.509 based PKI? (5)</b></p>

<p>One mark for each correct thing given. Possible points include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>(pro) puts most "trust" complexity into the server</li>
  <li>(pro) supports xml applications "natively"</li>
  <li>(con) supports xml application "natively" (if defended properly via
    valid criticism of xml!)</li>
  <li>(con) client doesn't clearly know the basis for "trust" </li>
  <li>(pro) client doesn't clearly know the basis for "trust" (real
    applications don't care)</li>
  <li>(con) responder has to be on-line for anything to work</li>
  <li>(pro) no concept of non-repudiation</li>
  <li>(pro) no explicit encoding of "trust" parameters enforced, can all be
    encoded in service URL</li>
</ul>

<p><b>(d) Give an example of when you might choose to use an XKMS bsaed PKI
and say why. (5)</b></p>

<p>The example should be convincing (1), clearly described (1) and justified
(3).</p>

<p>Good examples will mainly be xml applications that could make use of
xmlsig, so basically anything layered on SOAP that could require a signature
- say any kind of payment application. Justificiation should either repeat
some of the pros from (c) or else add new ones. New ones are better.</p>

<h2>Question 7</h2>

<p><b>(a) Describe a practical key management scheme (e.g. the SSL/TLS
handshake or Kerberos or S/MIME), noting the advantages/pitfalls of your
chosen scheme. (10)</b></p>

<p>Straight chance to describe a scheme (almost all of 'em pick TLS here).
For TLS they should include the basics of the handshake (2), the details of
whose key is used where (2) and mention of the application record crypto (2).
Other aspects like the fact that client authentication exists and the ways
that revocation can be supported (OCSP, CRLs) get one each, with 2 more marks
for overall goodness.</p>

<p><b>(b) Describe some of the issues that might arise when configuring
clients or servers for your chosen scheme. (5)</b></p>

<p>One mark for each thing like those below and one for overall goodness:</p>
<ul>
  <li>server key generation</li>
  <li>server certification request creation </li>
  <li>dealing with a CA or making a self-cert</li>
  <li>choosing allowed/disallowed ciphersuites</li>
  <li>interacting with authorizatoin (e.g. set URLs where parts of cert are
    made available)</li>
  <li>configuring session resumption </li>
  <li>anti-DoS limits (not that any standard code supports that now
  afaik)</li>
  <li>revocation information sources/options (OCSP, CRLs...)</li>
  <li>trusted roots in clients (and servers!)</li>
</ul>

<p><b>(c) How might mis-configuration might cause security problems for this
scheme? (5)</b></p>

<p>Same as the last part.</p>
<ul>
  <li>unprotected/easily modified trusted root list =&gt; game over</li>
  <li>lack of revocation support =&gt; opens a window, e.g. for fired
    employees</li>
  <li>weak (aka export) ciphersuites exist &amp; shouldn't be allowed =&gt;
    eavesdropping</li>
  <li>bogus revocation or certificate sources =&gt; TCP timeout =&gt; DoS on
    server if done right (details here might get some bonus points if they
    clearly know what they're on about)</li>
  <li>badly configured interface with authorization (say in httpd.conf) =&gt;
    wrong pages open/closed</li>
  <li>a wrong choice for X.509 initial policy set might cause many certs to
    be rejected (no-one's going to have read rfc3280 that closely though - if
    they do they get a bonus)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Question 8</h2>

<p><b>In the expectation that broadband bandwidth will increase sufficiently
in the coming years, you decide to develop a startup company to support
viewing movies over the Internet. Your initial target is to develop a system
that supports near-video-on-demand, where some minutes may elapse between the
time a movie is ordered and when the movie is ready for viewing (i.e. has
been downloaded). Clearly, payments processing, security, privacy and rights
management are important aspects of this system.</b></p>

<p><b>(a) Provide an overview of the system (including. e.g. a network
diagram) focusing on the security components. (5)</b></p>

<p>Good overview (1), including network diagram (1), showing secutity
components, e.g. firewalls (1). Last two points for overall goodness and e.g.
showing redundancy, use of content management system, split DNS, properly
showing interface with payments system etc.</p>

<p>Alternatively, they might equally validly focus on the DRM aspects (I
expect not) in which case they ought to show things like the content-owner,
distributor and maybe bits of infrastructure like TPMs etc.</p>

<p><b>(b) What do you consider to be the 3 most important vulnerabilities (in
terms of probability of occurrence and impact) for this system, as described
in the answer to part(a)? Specify a countermeasure aimed at each. (5)</b></p>

<p>Overall goodness gets two marks. Things like those below get one each:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Unauthorized superdistribution of content - leverage platform DRM
    facilities is ok, but even better (opinion!) is to watermark for
    traitor-tracing and separately monitor for torrents etc. that match. Real
    problem is that there is no truly effective countermeasure, but if they
    do say that, then they get a bonus!</li>
  <li>Unauthorized/free access - depending on how they've described a
    payments model you might limit access to an ISP's DSL customers, when
    directly connected, or else (or additionally) require registration, login
    and use of some secure pipe for authorized/paid-up users. Any such scheme
    has vulnerabilities and fairly obvious countermeasures.</li>
  <li>Network DoS - counters are the usual things like redundancy, cookies
    etc.</li>
  <li>Application layer DoS, e.g. requesting 10^6 movies from a real account
    - application layer rate limits</li>
</ul>

<p><b>(c) Assuming that the countermeasures you mentioned in part(b) are
implemented, briefly describe the main operational security policies that the
system adminstrators ought to follow, for example, if you included auditing
as a countermeasure above, say how the audit trails/logs should be processed.
(5)</b></p>

<p>As above, but correct focus on operational issues is worth a couple of
marks. After that, one each for things like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Logs should be usable - in various ways, e.g. times in whack,
    centralizable, queriable etc.</li>
  <li>Monitoring policies should define what's suspisicous and what's not
    etc. when on the lookout for superdistribition</li>
  <li>Three should be some consideration of an appeals process etc in the
    event of disputes</li>
  <li>Arranging with other content sites and ISPs to jointly monitor for
    unauthorized superdistribution in whatever ways are possible, e.g. by
    introducing bogus content, attractively named and watching for its
    reappearance, or by semantically modifying real content (e.g. delete an
    aspect of a scene) to detect the superdistribution. While this is not
    necessarily a highly effective, nor desirable, approach, given that it is
    proposed by DRM proponents, it would be worth a mark!</li>
  <li>There should be many checks on employee behaviour since insiders are
    usually where such systems can break down with worst impact, e.g. if an
    insider removed access controls and totally opened up the entire library
    at a lower layer (e.g. via some DB api), then the entire system is
    compromised. Operationally, IDS type monitoring might show up that this
    has happened (as well as DB logs etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p><b>(d) Given all of the above, how might an attacker still successfully
abuse your system? (5)</b></p>

<p>Straight marks-from-5 with credit for inventiveness. Possible ways might
include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>injection of unlicensened content to get MPAA annoyed with the
  system</li>
  <li>recoding movies to remove traitor-tracing watermarks (always a
    possibility)</li>
  <li>redistributing versions via another medium, i.e. DVD</li>
  <li>mount a directed phishing attack to find actual users in order to
    access the movie data so as to cut DVDs or other wise redistribute</li>
  <li>spyware on real user's hosts could access a movie and redistribute
    (albeit at the user's uplink rate, but the spyware isn't in a hurry)</li>
</ul>
