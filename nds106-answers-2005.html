<p><b>Question 1.</b></p>

<p><b>a) Describe how you would handle the following scenarios. For each
case, provide your reasons.</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>you are a CS reserarcher and discover a buffer overrun vulnerability
    in a standard web browser (5)</b></li>
  <li><b>you are a programmer and discover, and validate an exploit for, a
    vulnerability in your main competitor's product (5)</b></li>
  <li><b>you are a system administrator in a large enterprise and hear about
    a vulnerability for which there is no patch, and which potentially
    affects many of your server systems (5)</b></li>
</ul>

<p>Marking scheme is the same for each. 2 points for a sensible description
of the actions to take; 2 points for sensible justification and 1 point for
extra detail or insight.</p>

<p>For the 1st one a sample answer might cover:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Actions: check vulnerability databases to see if vulnerability is new,
  check whether a workaround is possible and which versions of the browser
  are affected, if source code is available develop a fix, write exploit code
  to be sure the vulnerability is real, contact the maintainer/vendor of the
  browser supplying all relevant information and give them time to respond
  indicating the intent to publish the vulnerability, (an alternative would
  be to contact a CERT)</p>

  <p>Reasons: (same things in same order) vulnerabilities are often
  discovered more than once, especially in browsers; typically not everyone
  can update their browser from the affected versions so providing a
  workaround (e.g. via configuration) is only fair (if its possible); clearly
  its nicer to let people know which versions are affected as is developing a
  fix; writing exploit code is arguably necesary since otherwise you can
  never be sure how serious a vulnerability has been discovered, with buffer
  overruns, it will normally be easy enough to get root; contacting the
  maintainer/vendor with such a proposition is arguably a fair way to
  proceed, given the propensity of vendors to sit on known security bugs for
  extended periods, in any case the vulnerability will probably be
  re-discovered, or will have already been discovered by the bad guys so
  there's no real harm in publishing the exploit and the existence of the
  exploit code will act as a spur to the maintainer/vendor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Note that the approach above is not the only reasonable one, another
would be to go via a CERT, or a vendor-driven process. The main thing is that
the reasons given are cogent and self-consistent.)</p>

<p><b>b) You are a working as a software architect in a small near start-up
and are responsible for developing their software engineering standards and
practices (e.g. coding standards, source code control etc.). Describe how you
would handle security issues as part of this. (10)</b></p>

<p>The answer should cover the following points or similar (0.5 points for a
mention, 1 more for a good description).</p>
<ul>
  <li>Basic design documentation and source code control (versioning
  etc.)</li>
  <li>Ensuring that all design documents contain some sensible "security
    considerations"</li>
  <li>Ensuring that default value settings consider security</li>
  <li>Access control (incl. physical) to design documentation and code</li>
  <li>Security reviews at early and late stages in the development of new
    functionality</li>
  <li>Code reviews for security (as well as functionality)</li>
  <li>Planning ahead for potential common criteria/ITSEC/Orange Book
    evaluations</li>
  <li>Use of static and dynamic code analysis tools to reduce bad code
    (buffer overruns, unsafe system calls etc.)</li>
  <li>Testing and QA directed at security, e.g. testing with "broken"
    protocol drivers to ensure fail-safety</li>
  <li>Ensuring installers etc. also have a security model</li>
  <li>Ensuring user documentation describes what user's ought to know about
    runinng applications relatively securely</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Question 2.</b></p>

<p><b>You are a consultant who has been tasked to develop a next generation
voting and polling scheme for a popular reality TV show. This system is one
of the main revenue earner's which pays for the show. At peak usage, there
may be millions of votes in a 24-hour period. The voting process continues
for a number of weeks as contestants are eliminated. While there are no
prizes for the voters, substantial sums of money are being bet (online and
off-line) as to the outcomes The programme-maker has no relationship with the
bookmakers taking bets on the outcomes.</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Describe the main threats to and the set of security requirements
    which you would have the system meet. [Note: focus on requirements here,
    not on technologies.] (10)</b></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>4 points for identifying relevant threats (1 each more or less) and 6
  for describing security requirements and not solutions</p>

  <p>Some potential threats:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Polling company (assuming they are a separate company) insider being
      bought off to manipulate votes</li>
    <li>Orchestrated web based voting (like a DDoS but where zombies vote
      instead of attacking)</li>
    <li>Distribution of voting links via SPAM emails or SMS messages
      (potentially misleading ones too, e.g. send "click to vote for
      <p>Alice" to Alice's home town but where actual link (or to-be-called
      number) is for Bob.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Various web-server, SMS gateway, DB attacks from the Internet</li>
    <li>Not a threat, but a relevant factor: bookmakers can be the attackers
      as well as their clients!</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Some security requirements:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensuring a separate polling company has well-defined and enforced
      security policies and accountability mechanisms</li>
    <li>"Hardening" the various servers against the current-known range of
      likely network attacks</li>
    <li>Providing data integrity mechanisms which cover voting data</li>
    <li>Ensuring the confidentiality of voting data until voting process is
      complete</li>
    <li>Providing a way to analyse past votes in order to spot patterns
      potentially indicative of misbehaviour</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><b>Provide an outline design for the entire system, emphasising the
    security model and components affecting security. (10)</b></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>The description should cover how SMS and Web based voting may occur and
  include databases which are to be used. (Most likely in a block-diagram.)
  The security model description demonstrate security services and mechanisms
  which match the set of requirements (e.g. the use of SSL for web based
  voting, some DB integrity mechanism, handling duplicate SMS based votes
  etc.).</p>

  <p>Marking scheme is 1-2 points for an overview (block diagram etc.) then
  1-2 points for each requirement which is covered, and an overall mark of
  1-2 points for general security awareness.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><b>Describe how you would test the security of the implemented system,
    prior to its being used for the show (5)</b></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>The answer should cover a mixture of code review, security analysis,
  internal testing, stress testing and tiger-team testing. Marking scheme
  here is more or less one point per useful aspect described.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Question 3.</b></p>

<p><b>Describe in detail how scaling issues affect a practical key management
scheme (e.g. Kerberos, S/MIME, IKE, or TLS). (15)</b></p>

<p>Marking scheme: generally correct description of the chosen scheme: 5
marks, identifying some relevant scaling issues 1 mark for each good
description (up to 7), 3 additional marks for overall depth of description,
correctness and insight.</p>

<p>Possible scaling issues for say Kerberos (others are similar):</p>
<ul>
  <li>9am "rush"/busy-hour processing</li>
  <li>single point of failure (AS)</li>
  <li>replication of KDC</li>
  <li>size of user DB (and access times etc)</li>
  <li>number of applications to manage (DCE approach of server key)</li>
  <li>audit analysis tools more important when many records created</li>
  <li>clock sync. requirement gets harder the more hosts there are</li>
  <li>managing inter-realm kerberos is harder, but realms make sense when you
    scale</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Compare the use of cryptographic primitives (e.g. signing, MACing,
digesting) in your chosen scheme with another such scheme. (10)</b></p>

<p>2 marks for each correctly described aspect, not already mentioned above,
2 additional marks for overall correctness, coverage and insight.</p>

<p>E.g. comparing Kerberos with TLS:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Kerberos default algorithm selections are older (DES in RFC1510, not
    3DES)</li>
  <li>TLS (mainly) uses asymmetric crypto for authentication whereas Kerberos
    mainly uses shared secrets</li>
  <li>TLS derives many keys from the pre-master secret, Kerberos just has
    session and sub-session keys</li>
  <li>Kerberos' use of digesting requires the entire buffer to be in memory,
    whereas TLS can work without requiring this</li>
  <li>TLS has a session-resume model, whereas Kerberos doesn't</li>
  <li>Kerberos tickets and keys (almost always) get cached to disk whereas
    TLS session state is not (usually)</li>
</ul>
